# WebVR Assignment 1 :octocat:
    
## Update: 
# About the Project 
The project opens with a switch just like an electric switch to demanding a click to proceed. Next, it opens another skybox with two circular links to other skyboxes. To decide which one to select, there's a cube in the primary that acts a hotspot.

Each of the three skyboxes that you'll see after switching on the switch has exactly two links to the other skyboxes. Some text is there in each of the skyboxes. That's all for now.

## Objective: Virtual tour    
         
  The Objective of this assignment is to create a Virtual WebVR experience using A-Frame through which y'all will get to familiarize yourself with the basic functioning of A-Frame and learn to **create photospheres, assigning controls to buttons, interaction with objects**. The individual tasks will be - **Stepwise, they would carry scores, and shall to the point** 🎯... Don't tryna copy someone else's work..(we can easily figure out :innocent:).  
    
## Resources
  
  > Get started with reading the docs at [Aframe Docs](https://aframe.io/docs/1.0.0/introduction/)    
  > Follow along this man's playlist [Aframe- Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRtjMdoYXLf4inSULAHyCMqpIUj4cmBTr)   
  > And this one too [Aframe- Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUtkqA7NXVH7ctoJYhsh4xqJn3iWMpP30)  
   
  This will be enough for the first assignment... 
    
  ## Tasks
     
   These individual tasks will be stepwise and will carry scores... Your knowledge of aframe will be directly proportional to how many of them you can complete... The more the better for you :wink: 
   
   ### Task 1 (Score it carry : 20)
      
  > **Create a Skybox**. Check for an equirectangular image that you can find from [Flickr](http://flickr.com/groups/equirectangular)... Then create something like this : [360image](https://aframe.io/examples/showcase/sky/)... Add cursor and camera to it... 
    
      
  ### Task 2 (Score it carry : 80)  
     
 > **Linking 360 images:** Creating the Virtual Tour Experience can be simple enough if you can link one 360 image with another to create something like this: 
   <hr><a href="vr2.mp4"/> Video </a>

> Hint: this can be done through javascript   
      
  ### Task 3 (Score it carry : 60)
  
  > **Adding hotspots**. A hotspot it some sort of object i.e. `<a-image> , <a-box>` etc... through which you can interact. You may have seen interaction with objects for animation and might have tried too.. But for this specific task you have to create info boxes as shown (not exactly the same :p):

> You can use `<a-text>`, maybe use some `<a-image>` for the eye icon, use JS for playing with opacity... Best is to do the way you like! , just don't use simple HTML Tags (`<div> <p>`) as they don't show up on VR-Headset and also avoid CSS Styling other than the ones supported by A-Frame (read docs), use JS instead...
    
 ### Task 4 (Score it carry : 40)
 
 > **Show your skills**. Just come up with what you have learnt and give final touches to this assignment... There's literally no restriction, you can add objects, create button, maybe introduce a videosphere!!!, make it as attractive as you can, you'll be judged on the basis of concept and not design. Just remember to add comments to show what extra you have done and it's functionality, push commits time to time and atleast after each task, preferably more.. :octocat:
